     ccvvttssuuddooeerrss can be used to convert between _s_u_d_o_e_r_s security policy file
     formats.  The default input format is sudoers.  The default output format
     is LDIF.  It is only possible to convert a _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file that is
     syntactically correct.

     If no _i_n_p_u_t___f_i_l_e is specified, or if it is `-', the policy is read from
     the standard input.  By default, the result is written to the standard
     output.

     The options are as follows:

     --bb _d_n, ----bbaassee=_d_n
                 The base DN (distinguished name) that will be used when
                 performing LDAP queries.  Typically this is of the form
                 ou=SUDOers,dc=example,dc=com for the domain example.com.  If
                 this option is not specified, the value of the SUDOERS_BASE
                 environment variable will be used instead.  Only necessary
                 when converting to LDIF format.

     --ee, ----eexxppaanndd--aalliiaasseess
                 Expand aliases in _i_n_p_u_t___f_i_l_e.  Aliases are preserved by
                 default when the output _f_o_r_m_a_t is JSON or sudoers.

     --ff _o_u_t_p_u_t___f_o_r_m_a_t, ----ffoorrmmaatt=_o_u_t_p_u_t___f_o_r_m_a_t
                 Specify the output format.  The following formats are
                 supported:

                 JSON      JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) files are usually
                           easier for third-party applications to consume than
                           the traditional _s_u_d_o_e_r_s format.  The various values
                           have explicit types which removes much of the
                           ambiguity of the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s format.

                 LDIF      LDIF (LDAP Data Interchange Format) files can be
                           imported into an LDAP server for use with
                           sudoers.ldap(4).

                           Conversion to LDIF has the following limitations:

                           ++oo     Command, host, runas and user-specific
                                 Defaults lines cannot be translated as they
                                 don't have an equivalent in the sudoers LDAP
                                 schema.

                           ++oo     Command, host, runas and user aliases are not
                                 supported by the sudoers LDAP schema so they
                                 are expanded during the conversion.

                 sudoers   Traditional sudoers format.  A new sudoers file
                           will be reconstructed from the parsed input file.
                           Comments are not preserved and data from any
                           include files will be output inline.

     --hh, ----hheellpp  Display a short help message to the standard output and exit.

     --oo _o_u_t_p_u_t___f_i_l_e, ----oouuttppuutt=_o_u_t_p_u_t___f_i_l_e
                 Write the converted output to _o_u_t_p_u_t___f_i_l_e.  If no _o_u_t_p_u_t___f_i_l_e
                 is specified, or if it is `-', the converted _s_u_d_o_e_r_s policy
                 will be written to the standard output.

     --ii _i_n_p_u_t___f_o_r_m_a_t, ----iinnppuutt--ffoorrmmaatt=_i_n_p_u_t___f_o_r_m_a_t
                 Specify the input format.  The following formats are
                 supported:

                 LDIF      LDIF (LDAP Data Interchange Format) files can be
                           exported from an LDAP server to convert security
                           policies used by sudoers.ldap(4).  If a base DN
                           (distinguished name) is specified, only sudoRole
                           objects that match the base DN will be processed.
                           Not all sudoOptions specified in a sudoRole can be
                           translated from LDIF to sudoers format.

                 sudoers   Traditional sudoers format.  This is the default
                           input format.
