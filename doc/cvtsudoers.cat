     ccvvttssuuddooeerrss can be used to convert a policy file in _s_u_d_o_e_r_s format to
     other formats.  The default output format is JSON.

     If _s_u_d_o_e_r_s___f_i_l_e is `-', the policy is read from the standard input.  If
     no _s_u_d_o_e_r_s___f_i_l_e is specified, _/_e_t_c_/_s_u_d_o_e_r_s will be used.  By default, the
     result is written to the standard output.

     The options are as follows:

     --ff, ----ffoorrmmaatt
                 Specify the output format.  The following formats are
                 supported:

                 JSON      JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) files are usually
                           easier for third-party applications to consume than
                           the traditional _s_u_d_o_e_r_s format.  The various values
                           have explicit types which removes much of the
                           ambiguity of the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s format.

                 LDIF      LDIF (LDAP Data Interchange Format) files can be
                           imported into an LDAP server for use with
                           sudoers.ldap(4).

     --hh, ----hheellpp  Display a short help message to the standard output and exit.

     --oo _o_u_t_p_u_t___f_i_l_e, ----oouuttppuutt=_o_u_t_p_u_t___f_i_l_e
                 Write the converted output to _o_u_t_p_u_t___f_i_l_e.  If no _o_u_t_p_u_t___f_i_l_e
                 is specified, or if it is `-', the converted _s_u_d_o_e_r_s policy
                 will be written to the standard output.

     --VV, ----vveerrssiioonn
                 Print the ccvvttssuuddooeerrss and _s_u_d_o_e_r_s grammar versions and exit.
