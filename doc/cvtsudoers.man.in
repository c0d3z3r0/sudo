.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBcvtsudoers\fR
can be used to convert a policy file in
\fIsudoers\fR
format to other formats.
The default output format is LDIF.
.PP
If no
\fIsudoers_file\fR
is specified, or if it is
\(oq-\(cq,
the policy is read from the standard input.
By default, the result is written to the standard output.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.TP 12n
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\--format\fR
Specify the output format.
The following formats are supported:
.PP
.RS 12n
.PD 0
.TP 10n
JSON
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) files are usually easier for
third-party applications to consume than the traditional
\fIsudoers\fR
format.
The various values have explicit types which removes much of the
ambiguity of the
\fIsudoers\fR
format.
.PD
.TP 10n
LDIF
LDIF (LDAP Data Interchange Format) files can be imported into an LDAP
server for use with
sudoers.ldap(@mansectform@).
.PD 0

\fB\-o\fR \fIoutput_file\fR, \fB\--output\fR=\fIoutput_file\fR
Write the converted output to
\fIoutput_file\fR.
If no
\fIoutput_file\fR
is specified, or if it is
\(oq-\(cq,
the converted
\fIsudoers\fR
policy will be written to the standard output.
.TP 12n
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\--version\fR
Print the
\fBcvtsudoers\fR
and
\fIsudoers\fR
