.Sh NAME
.Nm cvtsudoers
.Nd convert between sudoers file formats
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm cvtsudoers
.Op Fl ehV
.Op Fl b Ar dn
.Op Fl i Ar input_format
.Op Fl f Ar output_format
.Op Fl o Ar output_file
.Op Ar input_file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
can be used to convert between
.Em sudoers
security policy file formats.
The default input format is sudoers.
The default output format is LDIF.
It is only possible to convert a
.Em sudoers
file that is syntactically correct.
.Pp
If no
.Ar input_file
is specified, or if it is
.Ql - ,
the policy is read from the standard input.
By default, the result is written to the standard output.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl b Ar dn , Fl -base Ns = Ns Ar dn
The base DN (distinguished name) that will be used when performing
LDAP queries.
Typically this is of the form
.Li ou=SUDOers,dc=example,dc=com
for the domain
.Li example.com .
If this option is not specified, the value of the
.Ev SUDOERS_BASE
environment variable will be used instead.
Only necessary when converting to LDIF format.
.It Fl e , Fl -expand-aliases
Expand aliases in
.Ar input_file .
Aliases are preserved by default when the output
.Ar format
is JSON or sudoers.
.It Fl f Ar output_format , Fl -format Ns = Ns Ar output_format
Specify the output format.
The following formats are supported:
.Bl -tag -width 8n
.It JSON
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) files are usually easier for
third-party applications to consume than the traditional
.Em sudoers
format.
The various values have explicit types which removes much of the
ambiguity of the
.Em sudoers
format.
.It LDIF
LDIF (LDAP Data Interchange Format) files can be imported into an LDAP
server for use with
.Xr sudoers.ldap @mansectform@ .
.Pp
Conversion to LDIF has the following limitations:
.Bl -bullet -width 4n
.It
Command, host, runas and user-specific Defaults lines cannot be
translated as they don't have an equivalent in the sudoers LDAP schema.
.It
Command, host, runas and user aliases are not supported by the
sudoers LDAP schema so they are expanded during the conversion.
.El
.It sudoers
Traditional sudoers format.
A new sudoers file will be reconstructed from the parsed input file.
Comments are not preserved and data from any include files will be
output inline.
.El
.It Fl h , Fl -help
Display a short help message to the standard output and exit.
.It Fl o Ar output_file , Fl -output Ns = Ns Ar output_file
Write the converted output to
.Ar output_file .
If no
.Ar output_file
is specified, or if it is
.Ql - ,
the converted
.Em sudoers
policy will be written to the standard output.
.It Fl i Ar input_format , Fl -input-format Ns = Ns Ar input_format
Specify the input format.
The following formats are supported:
.Bl -tag -width 8n
.It LDIF
LDIF (LDAP Data Interchange Format) files can be exported from an LDAP
server to convert security policies used by
.Xr sudoers.ldap @mansectform@ .
If a base DN (distinguished name) is specified, only sudoRole objects
that match the base DN will be processed.
Not all sudoOptions specified in a sudoRole can be translated from
LDIF to sudoers format.
.It sudoers
Traditional sudoers format.
This is the default input format.
.El
.It Fl V , -version
Print the
.Nm
and
.Em sudoers
grammar versions and exit.
