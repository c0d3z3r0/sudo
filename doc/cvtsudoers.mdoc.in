.Sh NAME
.Nm cvtsudoers
.Nd convert between sudoers file formats
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm cvtsudoers
.Op Fl hV
.Op Fl f Ar format
.Op Fl o Ar output_file
.Op Ar sudoers_file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
can be used to convert a policy file in
.Em sudoers
format to other formats.
The default output format is JSON.
.Pp
If no
.Ar sudoers_file
is specified, or if it is
.Ql - ,
the policy is read from the standard input.
By default, the result is written to the standard output.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl f , -format
Specify the output format.
The following formats are supported:
.Bl -tag -width 8n
.It JSON
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) files are usually easier for
third-party applications to consume than the traditional
.Em sudoers
format.
The various values have explicit types which removes much of the
ambiguity of the
.Em sudoers
format.
.It LDIF
LDIF (LDAP Data Interchange Format) files can be imported into an LDAP
server for use with
.Xr sudoers.ldap @mansectform@ .
.El
.It Fl h , -help
Display a short help message to the standard output and exit.
.It Fl o Ar output_file , Fl -output Ns = Ns Ar output_file
Write the converted output to
.Ar output_file .
If no
.Ar output_file
is specified, or if it is
.Ql - ,
the converted
.Em sudoers
policy will be written to the standard output.
.It Fl V , -version
Print the
.Nm
and
.Em sudoers
grammar versions and exit.
