       sudoreplay - replay sudo session logs

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       ssuuddoorreeppllaayy plays back or lists the session logs created by ssuuddoo.  When
       replaying, ssuuddoorreeppllaayy can play the session back in real-time, or the
       playback speed may be adjusted (faster or slower) based on the command
       line options.  The _I_D should be a six character sequence of digits and
       upper case letters, e.g.  0100A5, which is logged by ssuuddoo when a
       command is run with session logging enabled.

       In list mode, ssuuddoorreeppllaayy can be used to find the ID of a session based
       on a number of criteria such as the user, tty or command run.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       ssuuddoorreeppllaayy accepts the following command line options:

       -d _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
                   Use _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y to for the session logs instead of the
                   default, _/_v_a_r_/_l_o_g_/_s_u_d_o_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n_s.

       -l          Enable "list mode".  In this mode, ssuuddoorreeppllaayy will list
                   available session IDs.  If a _s_e_a_r_c_h _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n is
                   specified, it will be used to restrict the IDs that are
                   displayed.  An expression is composed of the following
                   predicates:

                   command _c_o_m_m_a_n_d _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
                           Evaluates to true if the command run matches
                           _c_o_m_m_a_n_d _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.  On systems with POSIX regular
                           expression support, the pattern may be an extended
                           regular expression.  On systems without POSIX
                           regular expression support, a simple substring
                           match is performed instead.

                   group _r_u_n_a_s___g_r_o_u_p
                           Evaluates to true if the command was run with the
                           specified _r_u_n_a_s___g_r_o_u_p.  Note that unless a
                           _r_u_n_a_s___g_r_o_u_p was explicitly specified when ssuuddoo was
                           run this field will be empty in the log.

                   runas _r_u_n_a_s___u_s_e_r
                           Evaluates to true if the command was run as the
                           specified _r_u_n_a_s___u_s_e_r.  Note that ssuuddoo runs commands
                           as user _r_o_o_t by default.

                   tty _t_t_y Evaluates to true if the command was run on the
                           specified terminal device.  The _t_t_y should be
                           specified without the _/_d_e_v_/ prefix, e.g.  _t_t_y_0_1

                           instead of _/_d_e_v_/_t_t_y_0_1.

                   user _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e
                           Evaluates to true if the ID matches a command run
                           by _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e.

                   Predicates may be abbreviated to the shortest unique string
                   (currently all predicates may be shortened to a single
                   character).

                   Predicates may be combined using _a_n_d, _o_r and _! operators as
                   well as '(' and ')' for grouping (note that parentheses
                   must generally be escaped from the shell).  The _a_n_d
                   operator is optional, adjacent predicates have an implied
                   _a_n_d unless separated by an _o_r.

       -m _m_a_x___w_a_i_t Specify an upper bound on how long to wait between key
                   presses or output data.  By default, ssuuddoo__rreeppllaayy will
                   accurately reproduce the delays between key presses or
                   program output.  However, this can be tedious when the
                   session includes long pauses.  When the _-_m option is
                   specified, ssuuddoorreeppllaayy will limit these pauses to at most
                   _m_a_x___w_a_i_t seconds.  The value may be specified as a floating
                   point number, .e.g. _2_._5.

       -s _s_p_e_e_d___f_a_c_t_o_r
                   This option causes ssuuddoorreeppllaayy to adjust the number of
                   seconds it will wait between key presses or program output.
                   This can be used to slow down or speed up the display.  For
                   example, a _s_p_e_e_d___f_a_c_t_o_r of _2 would make the output twice as
                   fast whereas a _s_p_e_e_d___f_a_c_t_o_r of <.5> would make the output
                   twice as slow.

       -V          The --VV (version) option causes ssuuddoorreeppllaayy to print its
                   version number and exit.
