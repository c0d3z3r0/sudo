What's new in Sudo 1.7?

 * Rewritten parser that converts sudoers into a set of data structures.
   This eliminates a number of ordering issues and makes it possible to
   apply sudoers Defaults entries before searching for the command.
   It also adds support for per-command Defaults specifications.

 * New monitor functionality for systems with the systrace kernel facility
   (OpenBSD and NetBSD in the default system, FreeBSD and Linux with kernel
   patched).  When monitoring is enabled, sudo will fork a daemon that
   monitors the command being run and intercepts the execve() system call,
   allowing or denying execution of the new command based on a sudoers lookup.
   The SUDO_* environment variables are also updated if this is supported by
   the version of systrace(4) on the system.

 * Sudoers now supports a #include facility to allow the inclusion of other
   sudoers-format files.

 * Wildcard matches on commands now use glob() and stat() so that relative
   paths now work correctly in conjunction with wildcards.

 * Sudo's -l (list) flag has been enhanced:
    o applicable Defaults options are now listed
    o a command argument can be specified for testing whether a user
      may run a specific command.
    o a new -U flag can be used in conjunction with "sudo -l" to allow
      root (or a user with "sudo ALL") list another user's privileges.

 * The "secure_path" run-time Defaults option has been restored.

 * Password and group data is now cached for fast lookup.

 * Sudo will use the supplemental group vector if it is present in addition
   to doing string comparisons of the group members.  This is useful for
   systems with nsswitch.conf where group entries can be in either /etc/group
   or some other database (NIS, NIS+, LDAP, etc) and getgrnam() only returns
   data from one source.

 * The file descriptor at which sudo starts closing all open files is now
   configurable via sudoers and, optionally, the command line.

 * Visudo can now handle VISUAL and EDITOR environment variables that contain
   command line arguments.

 * Visudo will now warn about aliases that are defined but not used.
