What's new in Sudo 1.7?

 * Rewritten parser that converts sudoers into a set of data structures.
   This eliminates a number of ordering issues and makes it possible to
   apply sudoers Defaults entries before searching for the command.
   It also adds support for per-command Defaults specifications.

 * Sudoers now supports a #include facility to allow the inclusion of other
   sudoers-format files.

 * Sudo's -l (list) flag has been enhanced:
    o applicable Defaults options are now listed
    o a command argument can be specified for testing whether a user
      may run a specific command.
    o a new -U flag can be used in conjunction with "sudo -l" to allow
      root (or a user with "sudo ALL") list another user's privileges.

 * A new -g flag has been added to allow the user to specify a
   primary group to run the command as.  The sudoers syntax has been
   extended to include a group section in the Runas specification.

 * A uid may now be used anywhere a username is valid.

 * The "secure_path" run-time Defaults option has been restored.

 * Password and group data is now cached for fast lookups.

 * The file descriptor at which sudo starts closing all open files is now
   configurable via sudoers and, optionally, the command line.

 * Visudo will now warn about aliases that are defined but not used.
